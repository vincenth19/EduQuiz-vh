Letters to the editor must carry the writer's full name, address and telephone number, although the information is not necessary for publication. This requirement to provide personal particulars is a clear indication that writers are responsible for what they say. When a writer wants his voice heard, he needs to claim ownership of his voice. Responsibility is the name of the game.\n\"People today prefer living together to putting their signatures on a marriage certificate because they refuse to accept responsibility for the relationship,\" said social worker Ken Yip, \"and this is what is causing a lot of family problems.\" When we sign a paper, for example, a business contract or a bank document, the signature is a seal of consent, an agreement to take the matter seriously. Most governments and many organizations will not process written complaints if they do not bear the writer's signature. The absence of a signature, they explain, tells us that the writer cannot be too serious and therefore does not deserve a reply.\nThere are people who wish to remain anonymous  for various reasons. Multi-billionaire Mr. King donates generously to charity several times a year. He gives simply because he wants to help but not for the publicity his donations may bring, and he doesn't want his good deeds to make news. In other cases, people insist on anonymity because they are afraid of the consequences of revealing their identity. Crime witnesses may be willing to assist the police, but most are unwilling to give their names when reporting a crime.\nName or no name? The answer is very personal and lies in how much we want to get involved. We all have a name. It is a matter of responsibility to use it when we make a statement, a claim or an accusation. We all want to honor our own name, and it is only by stamping our expression of an opinion with our name that we honor what we say.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Kovar, a tree-climbing instructor, recently returned to the U.S. from Brazil, where he spent time developing a tree-climbing operation thanks to the \"slow travel\" movement.\n   Slow travel, is like the slow food movement, the practice of giving fast food in favor of homegrown cooking--the kind that takes hours to prepare and enjoy. Likewise, slow travel urges visitors to experience a place's natural surroundings and learn about the ecology in a way not afforded by extreme games. \n   \"Tree climbing is a slow activity,\" says Kovar. \"It's not something you do quickly and then you're on to the next thing or event.\" There is no such thing as a quick climb, especially for beginners. This wasn't a race against the clock or the fellow climbers. In fact, tree climbing is unlikely to ever become a feature of the extreme games. Many climbers refuse competition. There has already been so much competition in the world.\n\"When you stand below the tree, it can be amazing,\" Rusel DeMaria says, looking affectionately up at Michael's Triumph, a 150-foot-tall tree. But reaching the treetop, he adds, is an entirely different feeling. Likewise, his wife, Viola Brumbaugh, kneels on the ground and asks Michael's Triumph for permission to climb. \"It goes a lot smoother that way, \"She says.\nAnd climbing has been included into many educational programs. New Tribe offers guided climbs through its school, Tree Climbing Northwest, where \"we teach enough tree biology and forest ecology to raise awareness in our students,\" says New Tribe present Sophis Sparks. \"We know that the tree climbing experience deepens personal appreciation for trees. After climbing, people value trees more and are motivated to support preservation. This is not just to preserve their playground.\"\n   Perhaps that is why he struggles with the term \"recreational tree climbing,\" saying, \"I prefer to call it inspirational tree climbing.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Never mind that Beijing's dry weather seldom produces snow. It is cold enough in winter for snow-making machines to make a covering for the hills north to the capital. And the rapid growth of a pleasure-seeking middle class has formed the basis for this new craze .\nSince Beijing's first ski resort was opened ten years ago, the sport has enjoyed astonishing increase. There are now more than a dozen resorts. Clothes markets in the city have added bright colored ski suits to their winter collections. Mr. Wei, a manager of a newly-opened ski resort in  Beijing, sees the growth of an industry that could soon lead Chinese to head for the ski resorts of Europe. In recent years, ski resorts offering natural snow have opened in China. But many are in faraway areas of the country and can't really match the equipment and services of some ski resorts in Europe.\nBeijing's skiing craze is partly a result of the recent increase in private   cars. This has led to the growth of a _ in the capital's suburbs  , which until the late-1990s were unreachable to ordinary people. According to Mr. Wei, about 40% of the visitors to his resort come in their own cars. The rest are bused in by schools, businesses or government offices.\nThe problem is making money. Starting ski resorts requires quite a lot of money; hiring land from the local government, preparing the hills, buying snow machines, making sure there are enough water and electricity to run them, and buying ski equipment for hiring out to customers.\nThe ski resort where Mr. Wei works cost nearly $4 million to set up. And as so often in China when someone comes up with a good idea, many others rush in and price wars break out. Beijing now offers some of the cheapest ski training classes in the world, though with most people rather new to the sport, expecting a few more doing the same job.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

The last thing he remembers seeing was his daughter being born 13 years ago. Then the world went blank; he can only imagine what his only child looks like now, as a teenaged honor student. Bad luck is no stranger to this warm and thoughtful 37-year-old man. His mother died of cancer when he was 4, and his father, who was often ill, had to give him up to the care of the state when he was 11. He later worked for 19 years in a workshop making household goods, deathly boring work. Earlier this month, Alberto Torres's wife, who had just been laid off from her job, had to have a breast removed due to cancer and now faces a year of radiation treatments. Things seemed always to go from almost incredibly bad to worse. Even Mr. Torres's good luck has a dark side: Five years ago, his lovely guide dog pulled him out of the path of a truck. Mr. Torres was not hurt. The dog was killed.\nBut Mr. Torres does not feel sorry for himself. \"These are just little bumps you have to go over in your life,\" he said. At 5 a.m. on a recent morning, we caught up with Mr. Torres at a subway stop in Brooklyn, New York, near where he lives in a third-floor apartment (with no elevator). He had been up since 3 a.m., feeding his new dog, making coffee, getting ready. \"When you're blind, it takes a little longer to do things,\" he said.\nMr. Torres was beginning his two-hour trip to his job developing film in the X-ray department of the emergency room of the Bronx hospital. He would take the G train to Queens Plaza station to the R train, heading towards Manhattan. He would then ride the R train to 59th Street where he would walk upstairs to switch to the Number 6 train. At one point along the journey, he might chat with a stranger. At another, someone would pat his dog, calling him by name. People offered assistance, even seats. At 125th Street, Mr. Torres would transfer to the Number 4 train by crossing the platform. At 149th Street, he would go down to the Number 2. He would take that to East 180th Street where he nearly always has a long wait for his final train, to Pelham Parkway. Then he and his dog would walk 20 minutes to the hospital.\nIt was a hard job to come by. Before he got the job, Mr. Torres was determined to escape the workshop run by an organization dedicated to help people who can't see. He wanted a job developing X-ray film, something that everyone must do in the dark. He had to handle the long trip, as well as the work. \"Our philosophy here is that blind people can do just about anything except drive buses,\" it was the thinking about disabled people at the Bronx hospital. \"We find what a person can do rather than what he can't do,\" said the hospital's director.\nOne day a while ago marked the first anniversary of Mr. Torres's hiring. He developed 150 or so X-rays, his usual output, to celebrate. Mr. Torres works by himself in a small, dark room that smells of chemicals. He cannot wear gloves, because he needs to feel. It is hard work, related to emergency of lives. His immediate supervisor says he trusts him 100%. Mr. Torres makes $20,000 a year. But his motivation goes beyond money. \"If I start feeling like a victim, that makes me bitter. And why be bitter? That makes you go into a hole and stay there.\" he said. \"I'm not doing anything out of the ordinary,\" insisted Mr. Torres as he quickly completed the task.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

So whether they feel embarrassed about a zit on their face,or they feel embarrassed because they're not as tall as somebody,they can rap about it and let it out a little bit.\"\nTo expand the club and help more kids learn music,Aggeler sought the support of the community. The Berklee College of Music and local music stores have provided free equipment. The club has also gotten support from the Music and Youth Initiative,a nonprofit that develops after school music education programs in underserved communities in Massachusetts. All these have made it possible to provide kids who may not have the means to get private music lessons the opportunity to still learn music and get all the benefits that music education brings.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

And both are so dissimilar! What are the differences between friendship and love? Is platonic  friendship possible between persons of opposite sex? Let us try and understand.\nWhat is friendship? Why do we call a person our friend? When do we call someone a very good friend? If we care for a person, if we are always ready to help that person and if we share most of our thoughts with a person, they are our good friends. We can always count upon our good friends in an emergency. We are always sure that our friend will understand why we acted in a certain way. We need not explain anything to our very good friends. The friendship is so deep and the relationship is so close, that most of the things are automatically understood by our friends.\nWhat about love? In a relationship of deep love, all the sharing that we discussed above are taken for granted. But love transcends(,) all these. During love, we are attached with a particular person, while in friendship, one may have many friends. A loving relationship makes one so much attached to the other, that one gets pained if his/her beloved is hurt! Love also involves a physical element. Friendship does not have that. This is a vital difference. Nature gives us love so that the species can go forward. Nature does not give us friendship.\nYour heart beats will never increase in expectation of meeting your friend. You will not lie awake at night thinking about your friend. You will not feel totally lost, if you don't meet your friend for a few days. You will not have dreams in your eyes thinking about your friend. But in love, you will do all these and much more.

One person was killed and three injured in the first shooting at Northern Arizona University early on Friday. Later that morning a shooting at a student complex near Texas Southern University left one person dead.\nIn Arizona, police named the gunman there as Steven Jones, an 18-year-old first year student at Northern Arizona University.Mr. Jones told police he was approached by a group of men and attacked. He fled, produced a gun from his pocket and opened fire when the men caught up with him, Arizona police said. Witnesses told police that the victims were unarmed.\nThe second shooting in Texas happened later on Friday morning at the University Courtyard Apartments on the edge of the Houston campus. One student was killed, a freshman at the school, the university confirmed, and another person was wounded. Two people have been arrested as suspects and a third is still at large, said Houston police spokeswoman Jodi Silva.\nThe attacks came as President Barack Obama visited families of victims of a college shooting in Oregon. On arriving in Oregon, he was jeered  by gun rights activists who oppose calls he made for tougher gun laws after nine people were killed at Umpqua Community College, Roseburg, last week.\nAfter a private meeting with families, Mr Obama said he had \"strong feelings\" about gun control, adding: \"We are going to have to come together as a country to see how we can prevent these issues from taking place.\"\nOn the edge of this little American town, a few hundred protestors gathered to tell their president he was not welcome. Many were openly carrying handguns to _ their message. The demonstrators blamed the shooting here last week on two things: a failure to treat mental health problems and the designation of Umpqua Community College as a gun-free zone. Many of those we spoke to said they had travelled to Roseburg from elsewhere in Oregon to make their voices hear.

As she tried to gather her cows to a higher ground, she slipped and hit her head on a fallen tree trunk. The fall made her unconscious for a moment or two. When she came to, Lizzie, one of her oldest and favorite cows, was licking her face. \nAt that time, the water level on the farm was still rising. Nancy gathered all her strength to get up and began walking slowly with Lizzie. The rain had become much heavier, and the water in the field was now waist high. Nancy's pace got slower and slower because she felt a great pain in her head. Finally, all she could do was to throw her arm around Lizzie's neck and try to hang on. About 20 minutes later, Lizzie managed to pull herself and Nancy out of the rising water and onto a bit of high land, which seemed like a small island in the middle of a lake of white water. \nEven though it was about noon, the sky was so dark and the rain and lightning was so bad that it took rescuers more than two hours to discover Nancy. A man from a helicopter  lowered a rope, but Nancy couldn't catch it. A moment later, two men landed on the small island from a ladder in the helicopter. They raised her into the helicopter and took her to the school gym, where the Red Cross had set up an emergency shelter. \nWhen the flood disappeared two days later, Nancy immediately went back to the \"island.\" Lizzie was gone. She was one of 19 cows that Nancy had lost in the flood. \"I owe my life to her,\" said Nancy with tears.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Researchers from Australia say that the presence of the particles  in an eucalyptus tree's leaves indicates that deposits  are buried many meters below. They believe that the discovery offers a new way to locate the valuable metal in difficult-to-reach locations.\n              Dr. Mel Lintern from Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization (CSIRO) said, \"We've found a lot of the easy deposits in Australia in this way. Now we are trying to find the more difficult ones that are buried tens of meters below. And the trees are providing us with a method to be able to do this.\"\n              Using the Australian synchrotron - a vast machine that uses X-rays to explore matter in remarkable detail - they found gold in the leaves, twigs and bark of some trees. The amount of the precious metal in an eucalyptus tree's leaves were tiny. \"We need 500 eucalyptus trees growing over a gold deposit to have enough gold in the trees themselves to make a gold ring,\" said Dr. Lintern. However, the presence of the particles pointed to richer deposits buried more than 30m below.\n              Dr. Lintern said, \"We believe that the trees are acting like a pump. They are bringing life-giving water from their roots, and in so doing, they are taking smaller dissolved gold particles up into the leaves.\"\n              Currently, the metal is found in outcrops ,where the ore  appears at the surface, or it is detected through exploratory drilling.\n              But the researchers said that analyzing plants could offer a better and simpler method to detect untapped gold deposits. Dr. Lintern said, \"Not only do we believe it is a way of saving the exploration cost, because exploring for these deposits can be quite expensive, it also minimizes the damage to the environment because we are taking a very small sample from the trees themselves, as well as the leaves and twigs on the ground. The plant-analyzing method is certain to work.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

The first time little David came to our camp, he was hairless and worn out from medical treatments. He was also very angry.\nPaul Newman's camp counselors ( ) were hoping to fill David's days with fun and laughter. But David stayed inside himself, wanting to be alone, or in a corner of the cabin. At this camp for children with life-threatening illnesses, we had seen some pretty tough children worn out by cancer recover full of energy despite their illness. But we saw little progress in David no matter what we tried with him. Five days into the eight-day session saw a quiet, sad little pirate.\n Then something happened on that fifth night. Something at camp that we would call \"huge\". \nIt was cabin night. That's the time when campers and counselors spend lime together in each individual cabin instead of an all-camp activity. Campers love cabin nights because there's always a bedtime snack. On the cabin table that night were bags of potato chips.\nDavid slowly walked over to the table, leaving his comer to join the rest of us. He took one of the bags of the potato chips and started smashing  it with his little fists, as all the other campers looked on in disbelief, I wondered what the cabin counselor would do.\nThe college-age volunteer counselor positioned a bag of chips on die table in front of himself, and he, too, started smashing it with his fist. The campers went crazy as everyone ran to the table to get in on the fun of smashing potato chips with their fists.\nSomehow everyone knew, everyone sensed, that anger within him was now being released. \nFor the last couple days of the session, David was a different kid. He was a little nine-year-old boy again, trying to fill the hours of each remaining day at camp with as much fun as could be possible.\nSeveral days after the session, David came back again. This time, there wasn't anything he wouldn't try to fit in to his day. He sure was having a great time at camp. David asked me if I needed an altar boy when I celebrated Mass in the woods. Sure enough, he was my altar boy. I remembered how carefully he listened to me when I talked about death. 1 said it's only a doorway. You walk through the door and there's the Lord God and behind God a whole line of people waiting to hug you.\nAfter Mass, he said to me, \"Hey Fatha, a door, huh?\"\nA couple more days of fun passed and tonight was the talent show. The tradition is that campers and counselors dress up in costumes, and everyone gets a standing applause for singing and dancing or simply just acting like fools on stage.\n The show had begun: lights, camera, action.\nUnfortunately, the only action taking place in our row of seats was little David making his way from counselor to counselor to say an early good-bye to camp. He had become quite ill and had to go to the hospital because of this new crisis.\nWhen this little nine-year-old pirate stood in front of me, he gave me a hug and a big wet kiss on my cheek. 1 was crying. He was crying. A whole row of counselors was in tears. After the hug and kiss, he put his hands on my shoulders, and tears still in his eyes, said: \"See you on the other side of the door, Fatha.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

But I desperately wanted a family. I sought the help of a judge, even the commissioner of the Department of Children's Services, and was adopted just a week before my 18th birthday.\nWe have a lot to be grateful for and this holiday season let's not forget about the more than 415,000 youth in foster care especially older youth. These youth are the most likely to get overlooked for adoption, but they shouldn't be. They need and deserve a family just as much as young children do. Making an older youth a part of your family can bring just as much a joy as adopting a baby or a younger child--without all the diapers and potty training.\nMy adoption was life changing and probably the best thing that ever happened to me. I still remember the first gift my parents gave to me. It was a Mickey Mouse key chain with a key to their home. They told me that no matter what happened they would always love me and I'd always have a place to come home to. This is our 17th Thanksgiving together...\nMy first Thanksgiving with my family was a little overwhelming with lots of extended family including grandparents, aunts, uncles, and cousins. However, it's when I realized that I would never have to spend another holiday alone and that was truly an amazing feeling.\nI was always eager to spend time with my little sister, Beth. She was six when I joined the family. My dad always says he knew we were really sisters, and I was no longer a guest in the house when Beth and I had our first fight. Today, she's one of my best friends, and I'm her biggest cheerleader.\nThere were also bittersweet Thanksgivings. One we spent in my mom's hospital room. It was there that she helped me plan my wedding but passed away three weeks before the ceremony. My dad walked me down the aisle, and my sister was my maid of honor. Because of our bond, we were able to support each other through that challenging time and that's what family is for--the good and bad times.\nIt's nice having my dad and sister to share holidays and special occasions. But they're even more important when it comes to the little things--like having someone to share my bad day with, celebrate my promotion at work, or help me think through a difficult decision. It's in these moments that I just can't imagine being alone in the world.\nI'm so glad that I didn't listen to those people who said I was unadoptable, I'd never find a family, and that I was putting myself out there for rejection. It's a risk for older foster youth to consider adoption. _ But it's a risk they should take because life doesn't end at 18. It's really just beginning.\nIf you know someone who might consider adopting an older teen, please share my story -- and have him or her think of my family. They didn't get to see my first steps or watch me be a pilgrim in my second grade Thanksgiving play. But they taught me so many things about life, and were there to watch me walk across the stage when I graduated from college and law school and accompanied me to the White House last year as I was honored for my work helping foster youth.\nI look forward to many more Thanksgivings with my family, and I'm eternally thankful they chose me to be a part of their family.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Let's listen to what she said.\n   While eating at the restaurants in Paris, I noticed the French kids were either sitting in their chairs waiting for their food or eating fish and even vegetables, happy and satisfied. There was no shouting or crying, and there were no pieces of food around their tables. However, my 2-year-old daughter, Beth, took a brief interest in the food. She even threw food everywhere. She couldn't keep herself in her chair and ran around the table. Though by that time I'd live in France for a few months, I couldn't explain it.\n   After surveying French parents, I realized that they aren't perfect, but they have some parenting secrets that do work. French parents seem to have different ideas about raising kids. One of the keys to this education is the simple act of learning how to wait. It is why the French babies I have encountered mostly sleep throughout the night from two or three months old. Their parents don't pick them up the moment they start crying, allowing the babies to learn how to fall back asleep. It is also why French kids will sit happily at a restaurant. Rather than snacking all day like American children, they mostly have to wait until mealtime to eat.

But think about it for a moment. On the Internet, a big online company can be run by two guys out of their garage. So it is only reasonable that people shopping on the Net would be a little _ of the security levels.\nInternet giants such as Microsoft knew consumer confidence was the key to getting virtual shopping off the ground, and they work hard to make people feel safe to shop online.\nCredit card companies, too, quickly saw the potential for Internet shopping, and have installed things like online shopping insurance for people. If you ever have a problem with your online credit purchases, many credit card companies will happily refund  your money and then set their claws on the company that wronged you. Now that's buying power!\nThere are other bonuses for online shoppers, of course. No line-ups, for one. No annoying mall shopping carts with broken wheels and kids crying because their parents won't get them what they want.\nWhen shopping online, consumers can sit down, have a coffee, and wear their slippers, not have to worry about their hair or parking and just click through sale after sale. Comparison shopping couldn't be any easier. And thanks to courier companies getting in on the act, you never need wait longer than a day or two to get those all important purchases delivered right to your door.\nNo wonder so many companies are shaking their heads at traditional advertising and instead looking to the \"virtual\" world to attract online shoppers.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

That is, except in the small town of Piobbico, the self-declared World Capital of Ugly People. The road sign at the edge of the town even warns visitors that they are entering the ugly zone. People who consider themselves ugly have been gathering in Piobbico since the 1960s. That's when Ugly Club president Telesforo Lacobelli established a dating agency for women who believed they were too ugly to attract husbands. Lacobelli believes that he is ugly himself because he has a short nose in a country where long or large noses have always been considered beautiful.\nPeople from around the world travel to Piobbico to tell their sad stories of ugliness. During the annual Festival of the Ugly, which occurs on the first Sunday of every September, hundreds of people gather in Piobbico's town square to elect the president of the Ugly Club. Lacobelli wins the election every year. The Ugly Club has over 20, 000 members. They carry ID cards that grade their ugliness from bearable to extreme. A prize is awarded to Ugly Club members who qualify as extremely ugly.\nThe Ugly Club president insists that ugliness is a virtue. Since beautiful people get a lot of attention for their beauty alone, they have to work hard to prove their other virtues. Ugly people, on the other hand, are genuine and do not have to prove anything to anybody, according to Lacobelli.\nLacobelli is a spokesperson for ugly people everywhere. He believes that the uglier one is, the better life can be. Though the club enjoys making fun of beauty, especially beauty contests, Lacobelli has a serious side as well. He believes that too many people suffer from financial and emotional pressures because they don't meet society's standards of beauty. The fact that beautiful people are more successful in the workforce is a problem that Lacobelli has attempted to bring forward to the Italian public and government.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Try living with your eyes closed for a few years. \nBlind people are better at locating sounds than people who can see, a new study says, without the benefits of vision the ears seem to work much better. \nPrevious studies have shown that blind people are better than others at reaching out and touching the sources of sounds that are close by. Researchers from the University of Montreal wanted to see if blind people were also better at locating sounds that are far away. \nTwenty-three blind people participated in the study. All had been sightless for at least 20 years. Fourteen of them had lost their vision before age 11. the rest went blind after age 16. The experiment also included 10 people who could see but were wearing blind-folds. \nIn one task, volunteers had to pick the direction of a sound coming from about 3 metres away. When the sound was in front of them or slightly off center in front, both groups performed equally well. \nWhen sounds came from the side or the back, however, the blind group performed much better than the blindfolded group. The participants who had been blind since childhood did slightly better than those who lost their sight later. \nRecognizing the locations of distant sounds can be a matter of life-or-death for blind people, say the researchers. Crossing the street, for instance, is much harder when you can't see the cars coming.\nStill, the researchers were surprised by how well the blind participants did, especially those who went blind after age 16. In another experiment, the scientists also found that parts of the brain that normally deal with visual information became active in locating sound in the people who were blind by age 11. These brain parts didn't show sound-location activity in the other group of blind people or in the sighted people. The scientists now want to learn more about the working of brains of \"late-onset\" blind people.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Skaar was working late in her office at the First Internet bank of California. By 10:45 that night she was almost ready to go home when the phone rang.\nPicking it up, she heard a guard shouting. There is a fire! Get out of there.\nSkaar didn't panic. She figured that it was just a small fire. Her office building was huge. There were 62 floors and her desk was on the 37thfloor.\nSkaar called out to office mate Stephen Oksas, who also stayed late to work. But when they got out to the hallway, they were met by a cloud of black smoke. Rushing back, Skaar shut the door and filled the space at the bottom of the door with her jacket to keep the smoke out.\nThen they called 911. before they could call their families, however, the line went dead. That meant that they were completely cut off from the outside world. All they could do was wait and hope someone would come to rescue them.\nMinutes ticked by. Smoke began to float into the office. Soon it became hard for them to breathe.\nLooking around, Skaar noticed a small workroom. It seemed to have cleaner air. So they crowed there. That helped for a while, but in time even the workroom was filled with deadly smoke.\nHopeless, they tried to break the windows, but the glass was not breakable. Everything they threw at just bounced back.\nDefeated, they struggled back to the workroom. They felt weak and dizzy. Soon Skaar found Oksas had passed out.\nSkaar and Oksas knew they were lucky to be alive. Sunday is my birthday, Skaar told a reporter. She would be turning 29. but she knew she had already got the best present possible----the gift of life.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

But this is not breaking mews. In fact, it's old news.\nIn the 1950s, Harry Harlow conducted a series of experiments with baby monkeys that showed, without doubt, that lack of love and comfort makes for a crazy monkey.\nHarlow constructed a cage that included a wire monkey \"mother\" topped with a plastic face. In this wire he fixed Mom with a milk bottle. The cage also held another wire mother covered with terry cloth. The baby monkeys spent all their time with the cloth mother and only went to the wire mother to feed, demonstrating that a soft touch beat something to eat any day.\nHarlow's monkey work was important because, at the time, child care \"experts\" and everybody's grandmother had a \"no touch, no comfort\" policy toward children. They advised parents not to respond to crying babies, felt babies should sleep alone to grow up independent, and for God's sake put those kids down. But Harlow's work changed all that. Mothers were soon permitted to have their newborns next to them in the hospital.\nThe current chimp research based on Harlow's work shows that mother love not only makes for a psychologically well-adjusted child, but also makes for a smart kid. Bard and her colleagues evaluated the abilities of the chimps when they were 12 months old with standard human tests for children of that age, tests that ask little kids to imitate some action.\nThe highly raised chimps did better than the ones that were not loved, and what do you know, the well-raised chimps did even better than human kids on this small IQ test.\nSo we hear it once again. We are primates, social animals which need care and love. We need to be held and talked to and made to feel that at least one person wants to be with us all the time. And if we get that kind of connection, we are sure to be fine, even better than fine.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

They resort to starving, vomiting and eating only diet foods to try and be thin. Television is a big influence on them. They watch shows like Beverly Hills 90210 andMelrose Placeand feel they need to look as thin as the actresses on these shows. Society is brainwashing young people into believing that being thin is important and necessary.\nDiet commercials are constantly appearing on our television screens telling us that once we lose weight, we will be happy. While you're standing at the grocery store you are surrounded by magazines claiming to have the newest and best diet. Each month another new diet appears claiming to be the diet to end all diets. If diets really worked, then why are there so many of them? The reason a new diet pops up each month, is that last's month's diets did not work. The truth of the matter is that DIETS DON'T WORK.\nThe diet and fashion industries are not totally to blame for society's obsession with thinness. We are the ones keeping them in business. We buy into the idea that we can attain the \"ideal\" body image. We allow ourselves to believe the lies being thrown at us constantly. We are throwing away our hard earned money trying to live up to the standards that society has set for us. It's unfortunate, but in today's society, people have forgotten that it's what's inside a person that counts, not what's on the outside. We need to start loving and accepting each other for who we are, not what we look like.\nOnce again, I would like to stress the fact that diets don't work. Eating three healthy meals a day, a few snacks and doing moderate exercise, will allow your body to go to its natural set point. Next time you decide that you are going to start another diet because you feel you are too fat, stop, sign up for a self-esteem class instead.

In the lab, children 5 months and older crawl   and walk up, down and over adjustable wooden slopes  , gaps and steps.\nIt may seem like the set for a new reality television show, but there are no prizes, except perhaps for the researchers. They hope to understand what makes one child respond to another, how babies adjust their look to their hands and feet to handle objects, and how these very young children adapt to changes.\nThe findings provided by these eye-trackers suggest that babies may be more capable of understanding and acting on what they see than had been thought. \"Quick looks at their mothers' faces may be all they need to get the information they want. They seem to be surprisingly efficient,\" said John Franchak who studies psychology at New York University.\nAlthough sight might largely seem effortless to us, in reality we actively choose what we look at, making about two to four eye movements every second for some 150,000 motions   daily, said Karen Adolph, also a developmental psychologist at N.Y.U. \"Sight is not passive,\" she said. \"We actively adjust our eye movements to the motions of our hands and bodies.\"\nEye-tracking studies have existed for more than a century, but the instruments involved were typically desk machines. The wearable eye-trackers that Dr. Adolph, Mr. Franchak and their colleagues use are based on equipment developed over the last decade by Positive Science, a New York company, with money from the United States Naval Research Laboratory. They were designed to help scientists. Eye-trackers are currently being used in studies to learn the differences in how amateur and professional geologists   scan landscapes and how people examine signs when looking for exits during emergencies.\nThe researchers also found that during the studies babies looked at their mothers just 16 percent of the time. \"That is lower than expected.\" Dr. Adolph said. A large body of past research has placed importance on children watching the faces of adults as they name objects to learn languages. These findings suggest children may not have to look very long to get the information they need, either from people or objects. This gives a new understanding of how much information they need, or how quickly children might process the information.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

After all, he works for a large auto insurance company. It won't hurt to leave the key in the truck this once, he thought, as he filled his gas tank at a self-service gas station. But minutes later, as he was paying the money, he saw the truck being driven away.\nIn 2010, 1.6 million motor vehicles were stolen in the United States --one every 20 seconds. If present trends continue, experts predict vehicle thefts   could be over two million every year by the end of the decade.\nVehicle theft is a common phenomenon, which has a direct effect on over four million people a year. The cost is astonishing.\nMany police officials blame professional thieves for the large number of the thefts. It is a major moneymaker for organized crime. Typically, stolen cars are taken to pieces and the parts sold to individuals. But as many as 200,000 cars are smuggled    out of  the country every year. Most go to Latin America, the Middle East and Europe.\nOnly about 15 percent car thefts result in an arrest, because few police departments specially conduct in depth auto investigations. When thieves are arrested, judges will often sentence them to probation  , not immediately put them in prison because the prisons are overcrowded with violent criminals.\nOne exception is a Michigan program that calls for 92 police officers to work full time on the state's 65,000 car theft cases a year. Since 2006, when the effort began, the state's auto theft rate has fallen from second in the nation to ninth.\nHow can you protect your car? If you live in a high theft area or drive an expensive model, consider a safety system. It may cost anywhere from $ 25 to $ 1,000. Some systems work automatically - simply removing the key disables the fuel pump and the starter. When cars are equipped with such systems, thefts may drop by one third.

Roughly a third of the cargo was a series of scientific investigations. Some of them were from high school students in the US. For example, 10 students from the Cristo Rey Jesuit College Preparatory School of Houston were conducting experiments about microgravity and put their samples on the rocket.  \"I know that failure is a part of science, but I really feel sorry for my students,\" science teacher Greg Adragna told the Houston,  Chronicle .\nAstronauts at the ISS felt a more urgent disappointment, however. The cargo included 617kg of food. Now they will have to rely on supplies from a Russian launch on Oct. 29.\nLaunched in 1998 and involving the US, Russia, Canada, Japan, and the member countries of the European Space Agency, the ISS is one of the most ambitious international collaborations in history. Currently, there are six astronauts at the station, five male and one female. Three are from Russia, two are from the US, and one is from Germany.  They have lived together for about six months. The station gets regular resupplies from Earth, using unmanned spacecrafts. Food is always a big part of the supplies.  Most of the food is frozen and ready to eat, and often tastes bad-somewhat like trying to eat when you have a heavy cold.\nTo make space life better, however, scientists have made breakthroughs. Earlier this year, Russian astronauts managed to grow a variety of crops aboard the station. Next year they are going to try to grow rice and other plants. And, as transporting water to space is expensive, astronauts are looking for ways to recycle water. \"Astronauts on board the ISS already drink water distilled from sweat and urine<) ,\" Russian news agency RIA Novosti reported.\nIs that the reason the astronauts were so disappointed not to get the water from the failed resupply mission, by any chance?", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Here are some tips on how to do it safely and comfortably.\nWatch your feet--Pushing with the wrong part of the foot can raise your risk of developing a painful injury of the heel and arch , says Rob Werstine, a sports physiotherapist and board member of the Canadian Physiotherapy Association.  You should push with the ball of your foot, he says.\nLayer up--While it's still cool, wear layers of clothing, with clothing close to the body that breathes and outer layers that do not absorb water. Go for bright colors that increase your visibility .\nBe reasonable--If you are just starting out and aren't in good shape, don't sign up for a 50-kilometre ride. And while cycling is great exercise for people who want to get into shape, if your doctor advises you not to do tiring exercise, cycling shouldn't be your starting position, Werstine says. Walk to begin getting into shape and then graduate to cycling.\nFix the fit--If you develop lower back pain or numbness in your hands and fingers from cycling, it could be your bike isn't adjusted properly for your height. A good cycle shop can help you find the right height for the seat and handlebars, but if you have continuing problems, consider consulting a bike fit physiotherapist, Werstine says.\nBe mindful--You have to pay attention on the roads to vehicles, other cyclists and pedestrians .Consider taking a cycling safety course to practise your skills. Or do some reading about how to avoid dangerous cycling situations. bicyclesafe.com, for instance, lists 10 types of car-bike accidents and how to avoid them.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Many people speak it but few speak it really well. Practice is necessary in speaking English well.\nReading is also one of the things that will help you to speak English better. Read whenever you can and whatever you like! Read papers and Internet sites that you like in English every day. Then, you will see that the number of known words is increasing and you are able to speak with more skills. Then you will have made the foundations and a good basis of English. It is not good to stop and get stuck there.\nGoing to England or an English speaking country is a good choice, but many people cannot afford it. If you cannot go, reading and speaking with your friends will also help you to practice your English. However, I think that it is very good to visit some English speaking country to see and test your knowledge in everyday life. You will feel the everyday usage of the language in its natural environment. There your level of English is going to improve even faster. Your ability to speak English is better. Nothing can match the excitement and happiness when a native speaker tells you that your English is very good!\nFinally, in order to speak English well, you must be persistent and do it every day. It is like playing the piano. Pianists play it every day and so should you. Include English in your life and you will see where it is going. Practice, practice! Read, write and improve your language skills and you are on your way when you will be able to speak it with more and more confidence!", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Not necessarily, says Dr. Silva, a professor in Sociology  at the Open University, she also argues it is wrong to assume technology erodes(,) the quality of family life.\n\"There is the idea that technology has an influence on the family and the family suffers. My take is quite different,\" she explains. \"Technological change happens because people's lives change. And it is people's choices of how to live that creates processes of innovation  as well. The family has a role like the economy or like technology itself in changing the world. The imagination is important in driving the things technologists want to find for our daily lives. People desire to see nature as it is, so color television comes about,\" she says.\nIn another case, the increase in working mothers helped create a market for labor-saving kitchen equipment. \"The time that women have to shop every day for food is no longer available so there is a need to have a refrigerator for food storage,\" says Dr. Silva. \"The need to cook that food more easily and quickly, means you have developments in cooking technology like the microwave oven . The microwave oven already existed because it was developed for the navy during World War Two but it wasn't used in ordinary families until the early 1980s.\n\"Technologies for housework were as important as those for work itself,\" she says, \"So washing machines, refrigerators and microwave ovens are terribly important. We couldn't imagine what life would be like if we didn't have them.\" Technological changes in the kitchen have played an important role in the changes of family behavior, creating a new social focus in the home.\n\"With advanced technology, you can feed the family in an easier manner. People can do housework with less difficulty. But that doesn't mean that family practices are not important -- it's just a different way of doing things.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

I feel there are a number of reasons for this.\nSome people blame the fact that we are surrounded by shops selling unhealthy, fatty foods, such as fried chicken and ice cream, at low prices. This has turned out a whole generation of grown-ups who seldom cook a meal for themselves. If there were fewer of these restaurants, then probably children would buy less take-away food.\nThere is another argument that blames parents for allowing their children to become overweight. I agree with this, because good eating habits begin early in life, long before children start to visit fast food shops. If children are given fried chicken and chocolate rather than healthy food, or are always allowed to choose what they eat, they will go for sweet and salty foods every time, and this will carry on throughout their lives.\nThere is a third reason for this situation. Children these days take very little exercise. They do not walk to school. When they get home, they sit in front of the television or their computers and play computer games. Not only is this an unhealthy pastime , it also gives them time to eat more unhealthy food.What they need is to go outside and play active games or sports.\nThe above are the main reasons for this problem, and therefore we have to encourage young people to be more active, as well as _ them away from fast food shops and bad eating habits.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

For him, acting was just a matter of moving childhood games to a set.\nMaturity and independence came to Thomas early as he started work at ten. After his first audition  , he learned about _ . Though hurt and disappointed, he took a part in a tiny, unknown TV film in 2001. No one noticed his performance - no one except screenwriter Richard Curtis. Two years later, he played Sam, a twelve-year-old in love in Curtis's Love Actually. After that hit film, he played actor Colin Firth's son in Nanny McPhee. Firth then joined a film called The Last Legion and supported Thomas for its lead role. As a result, the boy played Rome's final ruler in the action-adventure.\nAt about 16, Thomas had to make a decision. Did he really want to devote his life to acting? Many people in the public \"aren't letting you be you because they see you as something special\", he says. Also, friendship made during filming was often broken soon after the project finished. Despite these things, he found enough joy and satisfaction in the work to continue. Actually, Thomas seems to find joy in difficulty itself. He played 10-year-old Adolf Hitler in a TV movie and a teenage Paul McCartney in Nowhere Boy. The subject of his film Death of a Superhero made it his most challenging film. Still, he found a positive message in its story of a schoolboy with cancer.\nThomas now enjoys roles in Game of Thrones and the upcoming Maze Runner films. Popular as those projects may be, most still recognize him as Sam in Love Actually. Sam seems to run after Thomas, just as he ran through Heathrow airport to his sweetheart.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

It's the world's largest company, which sells in three months what number-two retailer Home Depot sells in a year.\nWal-Mart exercises its power for just one purpose: to bring the lowest possible prices to its customers. At Wal-Mart, that goal is never reached. The retailer has a clear policy for suppliers: On basic products that don't change, the price Wal-Mart will pay, and will charge shoppers, must drop year after year. But what almost no one outside the world of Wal-Mart and none of its 21,000 suppliers know is the high cost of those low prices. To survive in the face of its pricing demands, makers of everything from bikes to jeans have had to close US plants in favor of obtaining products from abroad.\nIndeed, the real story of Wal-Mart, the story that never gets told, is the story of the pressure the biggest retailer constantly applies to its suppliers in the name of bringing us \"every day low prices\".\nThe giant retailer' s low prices often come with a high cost. Wal-Mart' s pressure can crush the companies it does business with and force them to send jobs overseas. Are we shopping our way straight to the unemployment line? Of course, US companies have been moving jobs offshore for decades, long before Wal-Mart was a retailing power. But there is no question that the chain is helping accelerate the loss of American jobs to low-wage countries such as Thailand.\nPeople ask, \"How can it be bad for things to come into the US cheaply?\" Sure, it's great to have bargains. But you can' t buy anything if you' re not employed.\nThere is no question that Wal-Mart's drive to squeeze out cost has benefited consumers. By now, it is accepted wisdom that Wal-Mart makes the companies it does business with more efficient and focused. Wal-Mart itself is known for continuous improvement in its ability to handle, move, and track goods. It is legendary   for forcing its suppliers to redesign everything from their packaging to their computer systems. It is also legendary for quite straightforwardly telling them what it will pay for their goods.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

A part-time job can teach teenagers important skills like responsibility , independence ,teamwork and leadership.\nYoung people can expand  their social circles beyond their classmates by making friends with co-workers. And many teenagers find that earning their own money gives them a sense of pride and freedom.\nThe US Department of Labor allows teenagers to apply for jobs at the age of 14. Popular part-time jobs include working in ice cream stores, coffee shops, and clothing stores. During the school year, teenagers may go to work a few times a week after their classes get out, then work for longer on the weekends.\nIn the summer, top jobs for teens include working at camps, swimming pools and amusement parks. These jobs are great for young people who want to be active and have fun while making money.\nA favorite job for many teens is babysitting , and they can start before 14 if the parents agree. After the children are sleeping and before the parents come home, babysitters have lots of freedom.\nAs long as they stay in the house and make sure the kids are okay, babysitters can do their homework, enjoy a snack, watch TV, or talk on the phone with friends.\nIt can be stressful to balance school, homework, and a part-time job.

The idea is that you should see and be seen by others.\nThe prom is not just an American tradition, though most people believe that it started in America. In Canada the event is called a \"formal\". In Britain and Australia the old fashioned word \"dance\" is more and more frequently being referred to as a \"prom\". Most countries have some form of celebration when students finish high school: after all, it means the end of life as a child, and the beginning of life as an adult.\nThe prom is expensive to organize and the tickets can cost students a lot of money. The tradition is that students themselves have to raise the money to pay for it. Selling the students newspapers is one way to raise money; so is taking a part-time job at the weekend.\nAlthough the prom should be the experience of a lifetime, it also worries many students. There is the problem of what to wear, who to take as your partner, who will be voted \"prom queen\", etc. And it is not only students who feel worried. What many parents find difficult is the realization that their children's school days are almost over.

What is less well-known is that the word \"prom\" comes from the verb \"to promenade\", which means to walk around, beautifully dressed, in order to attract attention. The idea is that you should see and be seen by others.\nThe prom is not just an American tradition, though most people believe that it started in America. In Canada the event is called a \"formal\". In Britain and Australia the old fashioned word \"dance\" is more and more frequently being referred to as a \"prom\". Most countries have some form of celebration when students finish high school: after all, it means the end of life as a child, and the beginning of life as an adult.\nThe prom is expensive to organize and the tickets can cost students a lot of money. The tradition is that students themselves have to raise the money to pay for it. Selling the students newspapers is one way to raise money; so is taking a part-time job at the weekend.\nAlthough the prom should be the experience of a lifetime, it also worries many students. There is the problem of what to wear, who to take as your partner, who will be voted \"prom queen\", etc. And it is not only students who feel worried. What many parents find difficult is the realization that their children's school days are almost over. However, for most people at the prom, once the music starts playing, everyone relaxes and stops worrying.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

You may be able to save 100% of your money. Does that mean you should? Not at all. The best way to develop good saving habits is to make saving a regular part of your life, along with spending.\nHere is the rule you should remember: save before spending. Whenever some money gets into your hands, from a job or your pocket money or whatever, take your savings out immediately, before spending any of the money. The beauty of this system is that if you take away your savings, you are free to spend the rest.\nHere are some more suggestions on how to successfully get into the saving habit from teens. Let's see!\nTony,13: I put my money in a bank instead of my wallet, so the money is not there. And I have to take an extra step to get it.\nBill,14: When considering a major purchase , wait a week or so, at least. This will help you make sure if you still want it, and the price might go down.\nDick, 13: Carry very little money always. You can't spend money if you don't have it. A cake would be nice, but without a dollar, you can't get it. Little things like that really add up quickly.\nSteve,16: I used to be weak when it came to money. I bought something whenever I went into a store. I'm glad I'm not that person now. I taught myself discipline by keeping a $20 bill in my pocket while waking around the mall all day and not buying anything. Now I have no strong wish to buy things when I go into a store. It works for me.\nThese ideas should help you get started.

It's very different from what I learned at school! Students in my group are from different cities of Britain and their dialects   are different too! Some of their accents   are quite strong and they also have their own words and expressions.\nBut it's not the language that's different and surprising. Before I came to England I had thought that fish and chips were eaten every day. That's quite wrong! I get rather mad now when I hear all the foolish words about typical   English food.\nI had expected to see \"London fog\". Do you remember our texts about it? We had no idea that most of this 'thick fog' disappeared many years ago when people stopped using coal in their homes. But the idea to speak about the weather was very helpful. The weather in London is really changeable.\nOn the other hand habits are different. People tell me what is typically British here in London is not always typical in Wales or Scotland. Local habits and traditions are not the same as what we knew.\nBut what is ordinary for all British is that they follow traditions. Probably Britain has more living signs of its past than many other countries. And people have always been proud of having ancient buildings in capitals, big cities and the countryside.\nI will tell you more about Britain in my other letters.\nLove from Britain,\nPeter", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Probably not, but there are many plants that eat meat. Some of them are big. And they can eat small animals. One famous meat-eating plant is the Venus flytrap .\nThe Venus flytrap is a very strange plant. It grows in dry parts of the United States. Its leaves are like the pages of a book. They can open and close very quickly. Inside the leaves, there are three small hairs. If a fly touches one of the hairs, the leaf closes quickly. The fly cannot get out. In about half an hour, the leaf _ the fly until it is dead. Then, the plant covers the fly. Slowly, the plant eats the fly.\nWhy do plants do it? Most plants get what they need from the sun, the air, and the ground. In some places, the ground is very poor. It doesn't have all these important things, especially nitrogen .

It seems that the stars are moving all the time.\nActually, there is nothing wrong with your eyes. This twinkling effect is called scintillation  . Scintillation happens because of air movements in the earth's atmosphere  . Light is \"bent  \" when it travels through different parts of the earth's atmosphere. As the air in the earth's atmosphere is moving all the time, the light from the stars looks as if it is moving too.\nThe same thing also happens to things on the ground. On a very hot and shiny day, if you look at the road, the image in the distance is not clear and things move slightly. You can also see the same effect if you drop a rock into water. The rock appears a little unclear under the moving water.\nThis twinkling effect causes a lot of problems for astronomers   since they cannot _ the stars clearly. A telescope   was sent into space so that the air movements in the atmosphere could be avoided  . It took a long time to build the space telescope but finally in 1990, a huge space telescope called the Hubble Space Telescope was successfully sent into space. Since then, astronomers have many important observations that have helped people understand space better.\n,.  (10)", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

The number of penguins have decreased  by 30% since 1987.\nPenguins are black and white birds that live in the southern part of the world. They are common in South America,New Zealand,Australia and South Africa. Many live near cold waters. But some live near warm waters in Galapagos Islands. Penguins cannot fly,but they are fine swimmers. Penguins eat fish and krill .\nThe warming of the earth is the decrease in penguin populations. The heating of the air has caused ocean waters to become warmer. Higher water temperatures have reduced the supply of fish and krill. Some years later these birds are completely unable to reproduce .  Besides,many adult penguins die of hunger.\nWidespread  fishing,exploration for oil and oil leaks  also make penguins be in danger. Poisonous organisms  in ocean water are another danger. Penguins also have their enemies,including wild dogs,sharks,seals and sea lions.\nNews about penguins is not all bad,however. Several years ago,oil leaking from a ship hurt 40% of the penguins in South Africa. The penguins became covered with oil. But thousands of people helped clean and treat the birds well. Then they returned the penguins to the wild.  Now these South African penguins are reproducing in higher numbers than before the oil leaking.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Take an aspirin or eat bird brains. Do you want beautiful skin? Use skin cream or eat pearls. Is your hair turning gray? Color your hair or eat black rice.\n\"Eat bird brains, pearls, and black rice?\" some people ask. \"How strange!\" But for many Chinese people, bird brains, pearls, and black rice are not strange things to eat. Instead, they are good medicines.\nFood that people use for medicines is called medical  food. The Chinese have eaten medicinal food and spices  for centuries. Ginger, for example, is a common spice in Chinese cooking. Ginger gives food a nice flavor. The Chinese began to use ginger many years ago. They used ginger not because it tasted good. They used ginger because it was medicinal. Ginger, they thought, was good for the digestion. It also helped people who had colds. Pepper and garlic, too, were probably medicines a long time ago.\nSome people don't believe that food and spices are good medicines. They want to buy their medicine in drugstores, not in supermarkets. Other people want to try medicinal food. They say, \"Maybe medicinal food can't help me. But it can't hurt me, either.\"\nPeople can try medicinal food at a Chinese restaurant in San Francisco, California. The restaurant serves medicinal food. The menus at the restaurant have a list of dinners. Next to each dinner there is information about the food. The information helps people order \"Queen's Secret,\" for example, is one dinner at the restaurant. This dinner has meat from chickens with black feathers.

The villagers asked him to leave, for they feared he wanted them to give him food. They told him that there was no food. The traveller explained that he didn't need any food and that, in fact, he was planning to make a soup to share with them instead. The villagers watched suspiciously as he built a fire and filled a pot with water With great ceremony , he pulled a stone from a bag, and dropped the stone into the pot of water. After a moment, he smelt the soup and shouted with excitement, \"How delicious the soup is!\" As the villagers began to show interest, he mentioned how good the soup would be with just a little cabbage in it. A villager brought out a cabbage to share. This episode  repeated itself until the soup had cabbage, carrots, onions, and beets--indeed, a full pot of soup that could feed everyone in the village was ready. This story describes when there are not enough resources , humans will store things. We do not want to share. The story of stone soup helps us realize that, in doing so, we often prevent ourselves and everyone else from having a feast .The meaning of this story goes far beyond food. We keep to ourselves ideas, love, and energy, thinking we will be richer, but in fact we make the world, and ourselves, poorer. The traveller was able to see that the villagers were holding back, and he had the ability to inspire  them to give. In this way, they created a large meal that none of them could have created alone.

Just look around you-it's East Asia. _ school leavers in major East Asian cities are nearsighted, according to the BBC. Experts say books and video games are not to blame. East Asian students, they say, aren't getting enough sunlight.\nPeople become nearsighted because their eyeballs grow out of shape and light entering their eyes cannot focus correctly. The body can produce a chemical called dopamine   to stop eyeballs from changing shape. And guess what scientists have just discovered? Sunlight can help our bodies produce more dopamine, reported AFP.\nAccording to the study, primary school students in Singapore spend only 30 minutes outdoors every day; in Australia, by contrast, kids spend about three hours a day outside. As a result, fewer children in Australia are nearsighted-only 10 percent, compared with 90 percent in Singapore.\n\"Children in East Asia basically go to school... go home and stay inside. They study and they watch television,\" Ian Morgan of the Australian National University told AFP.\nBut being a bookworm or a couch potato does not directly harm the eyes, added Morgan. \"As long as they get outside, it doesn't seem to matter how much study they do,\" he explained. \"There are some kids who study hard and get outside and play hard and they are generally fine. The ones who are at major risk are the ones who study hard and don't get outside. As a result of massive   educational pressures and the construction   of a child's day, the amount of time they spend outside in bright light is minimized.\"\nExperts suggest children should stay outside for two to three hours every day.

After all, everyone needs to eat! But each country has its own traditions on what people eat and when.\nEgypt\nEgyptians commonly start the day with a drink, sometimes going with bread. Breakfast can be eaten any time after this but before the day's main meal. In the past, this main meal was served at around 3:00 p.m. But now people work longer hours and eat when they get home at around 6:00 p.m. Dinner parties are held later, around 9:00 p.m.\nMost Egyptian meals include bread or ice, cooked vegetables and beans or meat.\nFrance\nFrance is known for its fine cooking, and its people take food seriously. Most eat three meals a day at fixed times and never snack between meals. Breakfast is a light meal of bread and coffee. They eat lunch at around 1:00 p.m. and a dinner with multiple courses after 8:00 p.m.\nThe French consider eating a social activity. Eating alone is hard to see, and eating while doing something else is unheard-of. The French take time to enjoy their meals and visitors should do the same.\nBrazil\nLike the French, Brazilians usually eat a light breakfast. Lunch, the largest meal of the day, usually consists of meat, rice, potatoes, beans and vegetables. Between 6:00 p.m. and 8:00 p.m., people enjoy a smaller meal with their families.\nBrazilians don't mind eating a hurried or light meal and sometimes buy food from street carts  . But they always finish eating before walking away.\nThe United States\nAmerican's ancestors came from many countries, so American eating habits differ. Some take time to prepare and eat a hot breakfast. Others take a bagel   while rushing out the door or just _ . For lunch, most Americans eat a sandwich or leftovers. Traditionally, families got together for a large evening meal around 6:00, but now busy schedules force many families to eat in turns. American restaurant servings tend to be huge.

The show tells us that fathers should take part in their children's growing-up. In fact, this topic was always mentioned by Zeng Guofan (1811-1872). a famous official during the late Daoguang Period of the Qing Dynasty (1644-1912).\nAlthough Zeng spent most of his time away from his family, his letters back home to his children and younger brothers have become famous. In these letters, there are many helpful suggestions on proper behavior . Many of his ways on child education are popular among today's Chinese parents, including reading classical books and so on. His child-raising methods are useful for today's busy fathers. Like Zeng, they also spend most of their time away from home.\nAccording to Zeng,  the purpose of education was to learn wisdom from books, rather than getting an official position. Children should know that the most important purpose of studies is to get more knowledge about nature and life.\n\"But now ,parents just want their children to be rich and powerful. \" Mr. Tang, a writer in China, said.\nSome teachers say that parents need to build a good relationship with their children. Parents shouldn't force  their children to realize their wishes.\nIn Zeng's letters, he asked his young children to do housework as part of their daily life, even though his children had many helpers.

It comes from the Greek words that mean \"to write with light\". But photography could only give people _ pictures. So scientists were trying hard to find ways to make pictures that can move. They made lots of experiments, but failed again and again. It was Eadweard Muybridge who finally succeeded. He was the first photographer to try this successfully. But how did he make it? It was an interesting story.\nBack in 1872, people didn't know exactly whether all four of a horse's hooves   left the ground at the same time when it was running. A gentleman called Leland Stanford made a bet with his friend about it. Most people believed that a horse always had one hoof on the ground, or it would fall over. But Stanford didn't think so.\nAt that time, it was hard to know who could win the bet, because a horse's legs move so fast that it is impossible to tell just by looking. So they needed a way to record the movement of a running horse. Then Stanford offered $25,000 to the famous photographer, Muybridge, to help find the answer. In the beginning, Muybridge failed to get clear images, but he didn't give up. He continued to improve his cameras. In 1878, after many experiments, he managed to get a sequence   of 12 photos. One of them clearly showed that all four of the horse's hooves were off the ground at the same time. And when the photos moved fast, people could see a horse running.\nThough is usually considered as the person who created the first movie in 1889, it was the work of Eadweard Muybridge and the bet that led to Edison's invention.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

For example, he didn't like the doctor's white coats, so he wore shirts with flowers on them when he visited his patients and he tried to make them laugh. The doctors at the medical school didn't like Adams because he was too different.\nBut Adams believed that people in hospital need more than medicine. He saw unhappy and lonely people, and he tried to help them as patients, but as people too. He spent a lot of time with children in the hospital and often dressed up like a clown to make the children laugh\nWhen he finished medical school and become a doctor, Adams opened his own hospital, called \"the Gusundheit Institute\",together with some other doctors. They wanted it to be a place with a different way of working with sick people.\nHunter Adams became famous during the 1980s, and in 1988, Universal Pictures made a film about his life. It was very successful. In the film, Robin Williams played Adams. Williams said,:\"hunter is a really warm person, who believes that patients need a doctor who is a friend.

Students are still taught to read notation so they can recite compositions that they would never listen to on their MP3 players or play with friends. Playing music enriches life. The question is: Why do schools teach music in a way that _ so many young people rather than catch their imagination? Can we do a better job of using the power of music to get kids excited about school?\nThe experience of an organization called Little Kids Rock suggests the answer is yes -- if we change the way music is taught. Little Kids Rock has helped music programs in over a thousand public schools and served 150,000 children. The organization has given 30,000 free instruments out, mainly guitars, and trained 1,500 teachers to run music classes in which students quickly experience the joys of playing their favorite songs, performing in bands , and writing their own music.\nThe key to Little Kids Rock is that it teaches children to play music the way many musicians learn to play it -- not by notation, but by listening, imitation and meaningful experimentation. \"The knowledge you need to get started playing rock music is very limited,\" explains Dave Wish, the founder of Little Kids Rock. \"In high school, my friend Paul taught me a couple of chords and my life was changed forever. On the first day of class, Little Kids Rock teachers place guitars in the hands of their students and get them practicing chords that will enable them to play thousands of songs. The kids decide what songs they want to learn and the class is off and running. Their progress is surprising. Within a year, eight and nine-year-olds are playing musical instruments, and giving concerts, even performing their own songs.\nOne of the biggest advantages that music offers is the ability to encourage students who are otherwise bored by school. \"I've had students start coming back to school because of this program,\" said Adkison Thomas, who heads up music for the Dallas Independent School District. He added, \"One of the best things is that the teachers discover a new side of their students. They see kids become successful who weren't before.\"", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Funny how some people believe that Lulu and I will feel hurt for life. But let's face it: It took me 30 second; I didn't put my heart into it. That's why, when you rejected it, I didn't feel hurt at all.\nThere's one more thing: I have come to understand what it really means to live a meaningful life to the fullest. To me, it's about knowing that you've tried your best, body and mind. You feel _ when the piano piece you've practiced for days and hours finally comes to life beneath your fingertips.

The boy finished the ice cream, paid the bill at the counter and went out. When the waitress came back, she began cleaning the table and then she couldn't believe what she had seen.

So why don't we learn to code   computer programs too? What coding has in common with writing, playing music and creating art is that it lets you bring your ideas to life. Coding is all about creativity and music and creating art Crearbing with code CoderDojo helps young perople around the world to learn computer  programming for free. When I went to my first CoderDojo class in Dublin City University in Ireland, at age nine, I didn't know anything about coding or even what it was. But I remember making my very first web page that first day, and being surprised that I could create such a thing. It was a great feeling that I think every young person should experience!\nBy going to CoderDojo every week, I learned how to make websites, apps and games. One of my apps is called Auto-Journalist. It can help journalists   and interwewees do interviews even if they are both really busy or live in different time zones. It is still in development, and I have showed it at an event called Coolest Projects Awards, where young people get to show the public what they have created with code. It's so mucbt fun to share one's creations, and to see what everyone else has made too.\nLearnuing environment\nFor the past three years I have also been helping to teach other young people at CoderDojo DCU. In recent years I have also noticed many more girls attending CoderDojo DCU to try out coding. This has a lot to do with the CoderDojo girls' classes -- girls and young women take part in it with their friends, and it doesn't feel like coding is a \"boy thing\". It is really wonderful to see this, because we need more girls and women in STEM ( Science, Technology, Engineering and Maths). It's a good way to leam more about technology.\nStart early\nOne of the main things I have leamed in the last few years is that coding is not only for adults, coding is for young people, too. And when you are a child it is a great time to start coding, because your imagination is the limit for what you can create !\nWant to leam more?

Detailed Task Rules and Requirements\n\n### Question Construction Rules:\n1. **Source Fidelity**: Every correct answer MUST be directly supported by information in the passage\n2. **Single Focus**: Each question should test one specific aspect of comprehension\n3. **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language that doesn't confuse the test-taker\n4. **Appropriate Difficulty**: Match question complexity to passage complexity\n\n### Answer Choice Guidelines:\n1. **Correct Answer**: Must be unambiguously correct and textually supported\n2. **Distractors (False Answers)**: Should be:\n   - Plausible enough to attract students who misunderstood the passage\n   - Clearly incorrect to students who understood correctly\n   - Related to the passage content (not random)\n   - Similar in length and structure to the correct answer\n\n### Content Focus Areas:\n- Main ideas and themes\n- Specific details and facts\n- Character motivations and actions\n- Cause and effect relationships\n- Sequence of events\n- Author's purpose or tone\n- Vocabulary in context\n- Inferences and implications\n\n### Avoid These Common Mistakes:\n- Questions with multiple correct answers\n- Distractors that are obviously wrong\n- Questions that require outside knowledge\n- Ambiguous or confusing wording\n- Answers that are too similar to each other\n\n## 5. Examples of High-Quality Quiz Questions\n\n### Example 1: Detail-focused question\n**Passage Context**: Story about Alice whose mother died when she was five, and her family couldn't afford a doll. Years later, her daughter arranges for \"Santa\" to bring Alice the doll she never had.\n\n**Question**: Why couldn't Alice get a doll as a child?\n**True answer**: Because her family was very poor.\n**False answer**: Because her mother died quite early.\n**False answer**: Because her family disliked her.\n**False answer**: Because Alice didn't love dolls.\n\n### Example 2: Inference-based question\n**Passage Context**: Story about Nelson Mandela's lesser-known facts, including his interest in boxing strategy rather than violence.\n\n**Question**: Why did Nelson Mandela love boxing?\n**True answer**: Because he appreciated the strategy in boxing.\n**False answer**: Because he wanted to be a boxer.\n**False answer**: Because he enjoyed the violence of boxing.\n**False answer**: Because he had nothing else to do in the prison.\n\n### Example 3: Application/Analysis question\n**Passage Context**: Article about different art zones in Chinese cities with their opening hours and locations.\n\n**Question**: If you are going to visit an art zone at 7pm, which one can you go to?\n**True answer**: Redtory, Guangzhou.\n**False answer**: Tank Loft, Chongqing.\n**False answer**: M50, Shanghai.\n**False answer**: 798 Art Zone, Beijing.\n\n## 6. Step-by-Step Question Generation Process\n\nWhen creating a question, follow this thinking process:\n\n1. **Read and Analyze**: Carefully read the passage and identify key information\n2. **Select Focus**: Choose one specific aspect to test (detail, inference, application, etc.)\n3. **Craft Question**: Write a clear, specific question about that aspect\n4. **Identify Correct Answer**: Locate the textually-supported correct answer\n5. **Create Distractors**: Develop three plausible but incorrect alternatives\n6. **Review and Refine**: Ensure clarity, accuracy, and appropriate difficulty\n\n## 7. Output Format Requirements\n\nUse this exact format for your response:\n```\nQuestion: [Your question here]\nTrue answer: [Correct answer]\nFalse answer: [Incorrect option 1]\nFalse answer: [Incorrect option 2]\nFalse answer: [Incorrect option 3]\n```\n\n## 8. Quality Assurance Checklist\n\nBefore finalizing your question, verify:\n- [ ] Question is clearly worded and unambiguous\n- [ ] Correct answer is definitively supported by the passage\n- [ ] All distractors are plausible but clearly incorrect\n- [ ] No outside knowledge is required\n- [ ] Answer choices are parallel in structure\n- [ ] Question tests meaningful comprehension, not trivial details\n\nGenerate exactly one multiple-choice question that demonstrates deep understanding of the passage while maintaining educational value and assessment validity.\n", "reasoning": {"effort": "minimal"}, "max_output_tokens": 200}}

So I dicided that the dog would be trained. This didn't quite go as planned. At 15 weeks old, she was nearly made to leave the Petsmart Training School.

My behaviour began to change. I began to smile at people when passing them in a street. I returned from neighbours. I started calling my kids, and to my surprise, they started calling me. I even tried to speak to my grandchildren over the phone once. I even was glad to listen to laughter from a 10-month-old granddaughter.

A taxi driver needs to have not only good driving skills but also a good knowledge of the city of London, from the loneliest street to the popular restaurant around. He has to be at the service of all kinds of passengers   at all times.\nA London taxi driver said the following about his job.\nDuring the night it is usual for him to stop two or three times for some food. He said, \"I never drink when I'm working, otherwise I'd lose my license  .\"\nHe normally goes home between two and three o'clock in the morning. There are times he has to stay longer and try to make more runs. He said, \"That's the worst thing about working for yourself.

She was told that her neighborhood used to be farmland planted with vegetables, corn and wheat. But looking at the new road, beautiful park and supermarkets, Yang couldn't see any sign that food was once grown there.\nYang is not alone. In recent years, many Chinese people have moved into new houses in country areas. Tall buildings have been built everywhere in the suburbs. The crops and fruit trees are no more. But these changes have caused problems too, warns Gan Zang chun, an official at the Ministry of Land and Resources  .\n\"Chinese cities are growing fast. This has made the area for farmland much smaller. This is really bad for the country's ability to grow food, not to mention the lives of farmers,\" said Gan last Monday.\nThe country needs farmland to grow food for the people of China. But the recent rise in house prices has made selling land a good business. A lot of land has been used to build new houses for sale.\nPollution, which makes land useless, is another reason for the big drop in China's farmland. About 2.67 million square kilometers of land in China have been polluted and turned into desert.\nThe government wants China to have at least 120 million hectares  of farmland. But there are only about 121.8 million hectares left. \"It will be really difficult to reach the goal,\" Gan said. He said that the government would fight illegal land use and stop farmland from becoming desert.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

Do you write a Weibo? If you don't, you are \"out\"!\nWeibo means microblog. People may spend much time writing a blog, but it takes a little time to write a microblog. Why? Because every message on a microblog is less than 140 words.\nMicroblog started in the USA. It came to China in 2009 and it grows very fast. In 2011, the number of Chinese micro-bloggers grew to 300 million. People write microblogs for many reasons. For many microblog users, it is a great way of learning the freshest news, talking with friends and sharing different kinds of information, including news, everyday life, pictures, music, videos and so on.\nIt is easy and fast to send a message on a microblog. However, this can also bring problems and even panic  . For example, when the big earthquake and tsunami   hit Japan in March, 2011, messages like \"Salt can help people fight radiation  \" were hot on microblogs. Then a crazy buying of salt followed. Later people knew it was just a rumor  .\nIn a word, microblog plays a new part in the life of Chinese people.", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

At snack time, the scientist watched the amount of food each child ate while they were in groups of either three or nine. According to the study, the more children there are in a group, the more likely they are to eat more.

But uncertainty is really another word for chance.\nWhen Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do. She took a job in consulting ,but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income by teaching students. Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school . Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted.\nShe worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there.

Probably not. The excitement of living is that you don't know what's coming.\nSure, it's hard to see uncertainty in such active light when you're out of work, or when you feel like you're failing. But uncertainty is really another word for chance.\nWhen Allison graduated from Harvard, she had chances all over the place but had no idea what she wanted to do. She took a job in consulting ,but she knew she wouldn't stay there. She took the GRE and scored so high that she was able to increase her income by teaching students. Still, she didn't think she wanted to go to graduate school . Allison knew she wasn't doing what she wanted, but she didn't know what she wanted.\nShe worried. All her friends were going to graduate school or starting their own businesses. She was lost and felt that she would never find anything out. After six years, Allison, by having a plan in mind, got married, moved to the Midwest, and used her consulting experience to get a great job. Allison realized that she spent her years finding her way: time well spent, and time we must all take if  we're being honest with ourselves. The only way to lead an interesting life is to face uncertainty and make a choice. Otherwise your life is not your own - it is a path someone else has chosen. Moments of uncertainty are when you create your life, and when you become who you are. Uncertainty usually begins with a job hunt, but it doesn't end there. Every new role we take on means another round of uncertainty. Instead of fearing it, you should find some ways to deal with uncertainty", "instructions": "# Generator System Prompt\n\n## 1.

For example, geese  fly in noisy, \"V\"-shaped groups. Other kinds of birds fly alone.\nSome animals stay active in winter. They must change themselves as the weather changes. Many change their doing or their bodies. For example, snowshoe rabbits grow white fur to help them hide in the snow.\nFood is hard to find in winter. Some animals, like mice, collect lots of food in autumn and store it to eat later. Some animals eat different kinds of food as the seasons change.\nSome animals hibernate for part or all of the winter. This is a special, very deep sleep. The animal's body temperature drops, and its heartbeat and breathing slow down. It uses very little energy. In autumn, these animals get ready for winter by eating much more food than in summer and storing it as body fat. They use this fat to keep them alive while hibernating.\nWater makes good protection for many animals. When the weather gets cold, they move to the bottom of lakes and rivers. There, frogs and many fish hide under rocks or fallen leaves. Cold water holds more oxygen than warm water, and frogs can breathe through their skin.\nEvery type of insect has its own life cycle and that is the way it grows and changes.

A group of people had been working on it for two weeks, but every time they finished one problem, another appeared.\nWe soon decided that the only way was to build a new house. It was something unusual because normally our goal was to repair old homes. The family was pleased with their new house that was 20 by 30 feet with three bedrooms, a bath and a kitchen.\nOn Tuesday of that week, I asked the family's three boys, Josh, Eric and Ryan, \"What do you want for your new room?\" Kids in the families we had helped usually wanted toys or posters, so we were surprised when Josh, the oldest boy said, \"We just want beds.\" The boys had never slept in a bed. That night we had a meeting and decided that beds would be the perfect gift. On Thursday night, a few adults in our group drove to the nearest city and bought beds and new bedding.\nOn Friday when we saw the truck coming, we told the family about the surprise. They were very excited.\nThat afternoon, while we were setting up the beds, Eric ran into the house to watch us with wide eyes.

You are a nice little boy!\" she said kindly, smiling.\nA special feeling came to him. These were the first kind words he had ever heard. He watched her until she went far away, and then he whistled to his dog and went directly to the river nearby.\n\"Thank you, dear! You are a nice little boy\" he repeated the woman's words. Then in a low voice he said to his dog, \"You are a nice little dog!\" Tiger raised its ears as if it understood.\n\"Unum! Even a dog likes it!\" he said. \"Well, Tiger, I won't say unkind words to you any more.\" Tiger waved its tail happily.\nThe boy thought and thought. Finally he looked at himself in the river. He saw nothing but a dirty boy. He washed his face carefully. Again he looked. He saw a clean nice boy. He was amazed. From then on, he had a new life.\nAfter telling this, the businessman stopped for a while, and then he said, \"Ladies and gentlemen, this is the very place where that kind woman planted in me the first seed of kindness.

Climate is the usual weather conditions in a region. Areas that have bad weather are generally less ideal as places to live in .

Each region offers different resources, and therefore attracts different groups of people. People who enjoy the beach can make their living by catching and selling the ocean's many fish and other sea creature. Those who prefer farming can take advantage of rich soil in valleys near rivers.

Your role is to create high-quality multiple-choice questions that effectively test a reader's understanding of given passages.\n\n## 2. Tone and Style\nMaintain a professional, educational tone. Questions should be clear, precise, and academically appropriate. Use formal language suitable for educational assessment while remaining accessible to the target audience.\n\n## 3. Background Knowledge and Educational Framework\nReading comprehension questions serve multiple pedagogical purposes:\n- Testing literal comprehension (explicit information)\n- Evaluating inferential understanding (implicit meanings)\n- Assessing critical thinking skills\n- Measuring vocabulary and context understanding\n\nEffective multiple-choice questions require:\n- One clearly correct answer supported by textual evidence\n- Three plausible distractors that test common misconceptions\n- Appropriate difficulty level for the content\n- Clear, unambiguous wording\n\n## 4. Detailed Task Rules and Requirements\n\n### Question Construction Rules:\n1. **Source Fidelity**: Every correct answer MUST be directly supported by information in the passage\n2. **Single Focus**: Each question should test one specific aspect of comprehension\n3. **Clarity**: Use clear, unambiguous language that doesn't confuse the test-taker\n4. **Appropriate Difficulty**: Match question complexity to passage complexity\n\n### Answer Choice Guidelines:\n1. **Correct Answer**: Must be unambiguously correct and textually supported\n2. **Distractors (False Answers)**: Should be:\n   - Plausible enough to attract students who misunderstood the passage\n   - Clearly incorrect to students who understood correctly\n   - Related to the passage content (not random)\n   - Similar in length and structure to the correct answer\n\n### Content Focus Areas:\n- Main ideas and themes\n- Specific details and facts\n- Character motivations and actions\n- Cause and effect relationships\n- Sequence of events\n- Author's purpose or tone\n- Vocabulary in context\n- Inferences and implications\n\n### Avoid These Common Mistakes:\n- Questions with multiple correct answers\n- Distractors that are obviously wrong\n- Questions that require outside knowledge\n- Ambiguous or confusing wording\n- Answers that are too similar to each other\n\n## 5. Examples of High-Quality Quiz Questions\n\n### Example 1: Detail-focused question\n**Passage Context**: Story about Alice whose mother died when she was five, and her family couldn't afford a doll. Years later, her daughter arranges for \"Santa\" to bring Alice the doll she never had.\n\n**Question**: Why couldn't Alice get a doll as a child?\n**True answer**: Because her family was very poor.\n**False answer**: Because her mother died quite early.\n**False answer**: Because her family disliked her.\n**False answer**: Because Alice didn't love dolls.\n\n### Example 2: Inference-based question\n**Passage Context**: Story about Nelson Mandela's lesser-known facts, including his interest in boxing strategy rather than violence.\n\n**Question**: Why did Nelson Mandela love boxing?\n**True answer**: Because he appreciated the strategy in boxing.\n**False answer**: Because he wanted to be a boxer.\n**False answer**: Because he enjoyed the violence of boxing.\n**False answer**: Because he had nothing else to do in the prison.\n\n### Example 3: Application/Analysis question\n**Passage Context**: Article about different art zones in Chinese cities with their opening hours and locations.\n\n**Question**: If you are going to visit an art zone at 7pm, which one can you go to?\n**True answer**: Redtory, Guangzhou.\n**False answer**: Tank Loft, Chongqing.\n**False answer**: M50, Shanghai.\n**False answer**: 798 Art Zone, Beijing.\n\n## 6.
