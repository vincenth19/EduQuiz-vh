## Core Task
Generate one multiple-choice question with one correct answer and three plausible incorrect options that test reading comprehension.

## Essential Rules
1. **Correct answer must be directly supported by passage text**

## Preferred Question Patterns
- "Why did [character] [action]?"
- "What caused [event]?"
